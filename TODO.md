# Project TODOs

This file tracks the development roadmap for `josolinap.github.io`.  
Use it with AI in VSCode to generate and complete features step by step.

---

## ✅ Done
- [x] Set up Supabase project + `notes` table.  
- [x] Created GitHub Pages repo with custom domain `josolinap.dedyn.io`.  

---

## ⏩ Next Steps
- [ ] Initialize Vite + React project in the repo.  
- [ ] Install Supabase client (`@supabase/supabase-js`).  
- [ ] Connect to Supabase and fetch random notes.  
- [ ] Display floating notes in the middle of the screen.  

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- [ ] Style floating notes (fade in/out, random position, animations).  
- [ ] If `note.link` exists → make note clickable, opening blog/project in a new tab.  
- [ ] Integrate AI (Google Gemini / OpenAI / Groq) to:
  - [ ] Analyze notes and generate summaries.  
  - [ ] Suggest related ideas.  
- [ ] Add an admin UI (protected) to add/edit/delete notes directly.  
- [ ] Expand notes system into categories (blog, project, idea, quote).  
- [ ] Add 3D/generated background (Three.js or Canvas).  

---

## 🧩 Stretch Goals
- [ ] Offline-first mode (cache notes in browser).  
- [ ] User authentication (Supabase Auth) for private note editing.  
- [ ] Integration with n8n for automation (auto-post notes from RSS/Twitter/etc.).
